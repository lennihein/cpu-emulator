# Introduction

As an advancement over older processors, modern Intel CPUs implement a number of optimization techniques that increase their efficiency. One of which is the concept of out-of-order execution, which takes advantage of the mutual independence of instructions that would normally be executed sequentially. A second optimization technique is called speculative execution and involves the prediction of whether or not a given branch is taken. With either technique, the CPU might encounter cases where the current CPU state must be rolled back to a previous one to ensure correct execution. For out-of-order execution this happens when an instruction raises an exception (e.g. accessing inaccessible memory). For speculative execution, this happens when a branch is mispredicted. A rollback causes some instructions that are currently being executed (in-flight) to continue execution for a short amount of time.

Even though rollbacks are meant to make sure in-flight instructions do not cause any lasting side effects on the microarchitectural state of the CPU, it was discovered that they can affect the contents of caches and other buffers.
The disclosure of both Spectre and Meltdown in early 2018 introduced a whole family of vulnerabilities that take advantage of both out-of-order and speculative execution to leak secrets over the processor's caches, or temporarily alter the program flow of other processes. And while the performance losses introduced by software and hardware mitigations are measurable, neither vulnerability can be exploited freely on a fully patched system. As a result, however, the process of trying to exploit one of the vulnerabilities for the sake of learning how they work in detail can be challenging. Apart from the software, which may be obtained by installing an older version of an operating system that does not implement any mitigations, one must also make sure their CPU is affected by the vulnerabilities and has not yet received any relevant microcode updates from Intel. Often times, this means that a user's personal computer does not meet these requirements.

We design and implement a graphical CPU emulator that supports single-step out-of-order and speculative execution and is vulnerable to select variants of Spectre and Meltdown. While it is a simplification in comparison to real hardware, the emulator allows its users to gain a better understanding of how exactly the two vulnerabilities work and can be exploited. Furthermore, the user may experiment with (ineffective) mitigations or implement their own microcode-programs that are executed once rollbacks are completed. We supply example programs that can be run by the emulator and serve both as an entry point for the user as well as the basis of our evaluation.

Firstly, chapter 2 briefly gives an overview of relevant components of vulnerable Intel CPUs, presents the concepts of out-of-order and speculative execution in greater detail, and introduces both Meltdown and Spectre to which the resulting emulator is designed to be vulnerable. Secondly, chapter 3 further describes the target audience of the emulator and to which variants of the vulnerabilities the emulator is vulnerable, while chapter 4 documents the implementation of the emulator by describing each main component and explaining how rollbacks are implemented. Additionally, it contains an overview of the set of ISA instructions available to the user. Furthermore, chapter 5 explores the graphical user interface by defining the goals its design is supposed to accomplish and documenting design choices and important features. Chapter 6 provides a demonstration of the emulator, which includes example programs, and determines how effective the implemented mitigations are. Finally, chapter 7 summarizes the other chapters, briefly reflects on how valuable the emulator might be to our target audience, and gives ideas for future improvements.
