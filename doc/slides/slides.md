## Topic

- Lab builds on SCA lecture

- Meltdown and Spectre mostly patched

- Difficult to experiment with
  - Personal computer often times not usable

- Goal: Vulnerable CPU Emulator that runs on many systems
  - Should offer a gdb-like interface

# Background

## CPU

- Frontend:
  - Fetches/Decodes instructions, maintains queue
  - Branch prediction

- Execution Engine:
  - Multiple sets of execution units

- Memory Subsystem:
  - Handles memory operations
  - Maintains L1 cache
  - Ensures data is loaded from other caches/memory

## Out-of-order execution

- Independent instruction streams

- Tomasulo algorithm:
  - Reservation stations

  - Common Data Bus
  
- Rollbacks

## Speculative execution

- Predict results of branch instructions

- Prevent stalls

- BPU maintains counters

- Rollbacks

## Meltdown

- Abuses out-of-order execution

- Meltdown-US-L1:
  - Define oracle array
  - Perform illegal read to steal secret
  - Embded secret-dependent oracle entry into cache
  - Await rollback and measure oracle access times
  
- Small time window

## Spectre

- Abuses speculative execution

- Different variations. Here: prediction of branch instrs.

- Spectre v1: Deliberately train BPU used by victim process

- Make victim leak secret into cache

- Direct consequence of speculative execution

## Mitigations: Meltdown

- Disable out-of-order execution

- Intel's microcode mitigation
  - Microprograms

- OS mitigations

## Mitigations: Spectre

- Disable speculative execution:
  - Completely disable
  - fence instructions
  
- Flush entire cache after rollback

## Our task

- Develop graphical CPU emulator vulnerable to:
  - Our version of Meltdown-US-L1
  - Spectre v1

- Must support single step, out-of-order, and speculative execution

- Implement Intel's microcode mitigation

- Other mitigations via microprograms

- Target audience: SCA students
  - Or anyone with basic knowledge of TE attacks

# Our approach

## How we started

- Must-haves, nice-to-haves, future work

- At time of Meltdown/Spectre publication: Skylake

- Filter components needed for our Meltdown/Spectre versions

- Build simplified CPU

## Our version
